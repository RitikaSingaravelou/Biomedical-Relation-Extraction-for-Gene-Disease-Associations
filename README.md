# Biomedical-Relation-Extraction-for-Gene-Disease-Associations
Project - CSCI 544 - Applied Natural Language Processing


Identified gene and disease entities present in biomedical texts using a BiLSTM-CRF based named entity recognition model implemented using Flair. A bi-level LSTM classifier is then used to predict the corresponding gene-disease relationships between these entities.
